		/*(Game: scissor, rock, paper) Write a program that plays the popular scissor–
rock–paper game. (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and
a paper can wrap a rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or
2 representing scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter
a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the
computer wins, loses, or draws. */
