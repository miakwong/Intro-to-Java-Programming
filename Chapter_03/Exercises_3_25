/*(Geometry: intersecting point) Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4), as shown in Figure 3.8a and b.
The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following
linear equations:
(y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
(y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule (see Programming
Exercise! 3.3). If the equation has no solutions, the two lines are parallel (see
Figure 3.8c). Write a!program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays
the intersecting point.*/
