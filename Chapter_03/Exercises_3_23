/*(Geometry: point in a rectangle?) Write a program that prompts the user to enter
a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the rectangle centered at
(0, 0) with width 10 and height 5. For example, (2, 2) is inside the rectangle and
(6, 4) is outside the rectangle, as shown in Figure 3.7b.*/
